Project Title:
 Iris Data Exploration with Python

Description:
This project explores the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning and data analysis. The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three species of Iris flowers. Using **Python** and data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, this project performs basic data analysis and visualization to uncover insights about the dataset.  
The goal is to explore basic statistics and patterns in the data through histograms and count plots.

Installation

 Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Iris-Data-Exploration.git


Data Analysis

1. Data Loading: Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn's built-in dataset.
2. Missing Values: Checked for missing data in the dataset.
3. Summary Statistics: Generated basic descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
4. Visualizations: Created a histogram for the Sepal Length distribution and a count plot for the flower species.

These steps provide insights into the dataset and allow us to visually explore flower characteristics.

Visualization

In this project, two types of visualizations were used:

1. Histogram: To show the distribution of Sepal Length across all Iris flowers.
2. Count Plot: To visualize how many flowers of each species are present in the dataset.

Conclusion

Through this basic data analysis, we have gained insights into the distribution of Iris flower measurements. For example:
- The average sepal length is approximately 5.8 cm.
- Setosa is the most common species in the dataset.
- The Sepal Length distribution is roughly uniform.
